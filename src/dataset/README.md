# Dataset

This folder contains sample datasets used for bot detection and analysis.

The data in this folder would typically include:

- Historical user behavior patterns
- Known bot signatures
- Mouse movement patterns for humans vs bots
- Keystroke dynamics datasets
- HTTP request patterns
- IP address reputation data

In a production environment, these datasets would be used to train the machine learning models for more accurate bot detection.
